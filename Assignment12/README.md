## Included Techniques
- Sizing – I controlled the width of .post, I applied this by using width: 300 px. 
- Overflow – Even though I do not have enough words to make this feature work, I did include a maximum height and overflow set to hidden how much content is displayed. 
- Border – I used boarders around my posts to make them stand out from the background. 
- Margin – I used margins to control the spacing between my posts. 
- Padding – I used padding to control the spacing between the content in my posts and the border. 
- Display: I used inline-block for better alignment on my navigation menu. 
- Dropdown – I created a dropdown for future uses on my forum page. This was done using a combination of CSS and HTMl navigation. 
- Position – My dropdown menu uses absolute positioning to control where it is placed with the button.
