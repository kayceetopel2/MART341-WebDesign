I am most proud of problem solving during this assignment. My table was not working, I went over everything several times and could not find out what was causing it not to work. After an hour, I finally realized I missed an end bracket from placing my image. It was such a simple mistake, and frustrated me quite a bit. I am proud of myself for sticking with it, and being able to find the problem myself.
