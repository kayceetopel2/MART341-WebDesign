# Project Title

## Techniques Used

1. **3+ Pages**  
   - I created three pages named Home, About, and Contact. All of them share the same layout and styling to maintain a cohesive theme. 

2. **Framework Integration**  
   - I chose Bootstrap since it offered a wide range of components. I included it in my project to enhance the overall design. 

3. **Framework Styling Elements**  
   - I used Bootstrap's built-in buttons and cards for consistency across the pages. 

4. **HTML5 Canvas**  
   - I included a canvas element on the homepage to display graphics that match the theme of the site. 

5. **JavaScript Functionality**  
   - I used JavaScript to add an image into my canvas element and to create a dropdown menu on the Contact Page that enhances interactivity and user navigatition.
