       <h2>8 Strategies to Get Back In Motion from the ADD Association</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>The Daily Brain Dump. Write down your thoughts, and review which ones are a priority.</li>
        <li>Create your tasks to be achievable. Breaking projects up into smaller projects creates easy wins<br> to help you feel like you've accomplished something.</li>
        <li>Keep your work schedule simple. Instead of trying to plan your work schedule for the entire day, <br> try to designate time for one task</li>
        <li>Focus on completion, instead of perfection. Allowing yourself to focus on completing a task <br> will have you crossing off more things on your list compared to when you are trying to make everything perfect.</li>
        <li>Make room for rewards. After completing a task find something small to reward yourself to keep <br> the motivation going to complete another one.</li>
        <li>Get up and move around. Inbetween large projects or routine tasks take the time to move around to prevent burnout.</li>
        <li>Try to keep things interesting. Repetitive work is challenging, so try to find ways to make things interesting</li>
        <li>Do things you love. It is important to still make time for things that you enjoy daily to decrease<br> mental exhaustion and reduce stress. </li>
       </ol>
