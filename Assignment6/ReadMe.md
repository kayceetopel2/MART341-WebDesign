# Which Website I'm creating and Why
I've chosen to create a professional blog for my work. The reason why I have chosen this is because I have been looking for a new way to do our programs Newsletter and if I can get this website functioning it may be the solution. Secondly, I know that there is plenty of content to add which will assist me in being able to create a fully functioning website with out the worry of it looking empty. I want to create the pay to be colorful, professional, and represent my works values. I plan to include pictures, graphics, and would like to mimic a newspaper page. 

# Reflection
This assignment took a lot of trial and error. I enjoyed being able to play around with a background color, and changing the width to fit the device made my layout more consistent. I do not think this design is my final, and I cannot wait to improve what I have so far. I made several adjustments along the way trying to figure out spacing and centering. I think the number one thing that is differing from my inital idea is the font. I know that when we get more into CSS and style functions I will be able to change those. When ever I ran into an issue I would copy code that I had used for a different function and change the paragraph or list to what I needed. It allowed me to change code functions while using other codes I had already created.
