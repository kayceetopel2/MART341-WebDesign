# Incorporate Required Elements:

## Three or more pages.
I created a homepage, about page, and contact page. 
## A clear, well-organized layout with strong usability.
My webpage is a simple layout that achieves the look of being organized. This helps it be easily used. 
## Use of an external stylesheet.
I used a styles.css sheet as my external stylesheet. This helped me achieve a unified look throughout my website. 
## Apply at least one font.
I used one font that was not preset into the system. I chose an easy to read font but was more visually appealing than Arial. 
## At least one image (preferably your own or fair-use images).
I used two fair-use images of Kalispell on my about and contact page. I believe these images break up white space on the page and are important to my website because they depict where I'm talking about. 
## At least one embedded media element (video, audio, Google Maps, etc.).
I used a youtube video about Kalispell on my home page. I did this because I wanted it to be the first thing people clicked on. 
## Structural and semantic HTML markup with a clean and organized page layout.
I used the skills I received in this class to create a structural and semantic HTML markup that is a clean and organized page. 
## Legible, well-commented, and error-free code.
My code is error free and legible on my webpage.
