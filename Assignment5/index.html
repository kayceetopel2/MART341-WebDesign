<h1>Website Ideas</h1>

<h2>Option 1: Local Private Event Rental and Catering Catalog</h2>
<p>My first website option is for a professional website. The website<br /> 
would be for people who are looking for local places to cater or book private events.<br />
The tone I would be aiming for is clean, clear, and easy to understand.</p>

<h2>Option 2: Photography Portfolio</h2>
<p>My second website option is a photography portfolio. This website would be bright, colorful,<br />
and engaging. I would create a curated design to the style of photography I currently shoot.</p>

<h2>Option 3: Corporate Blog</h2>
<h2>My third option for a website is creating a professional blog. This website would be<br />
like an online newspaper but for my work. My vision is to have it be playful and professional.</h2>
