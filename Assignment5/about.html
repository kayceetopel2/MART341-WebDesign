<h1>Why I chose These Website Ideas</h1>

<h2>Option 1: Local Private Event Rental and Catering Catalog</h2>
<p>In my current job I am in charge of booking social events, so I am constantly googling
<br /> places that offer catering or private space rentals. There is not a webiste I have found <br /> 
that has been able to list all local options in one place. That is why one of my ideas is <br /> 
to create one, so for people in positions like me do not have to click into each restaurant <br /> 
to try to find out if they have large scale offerings.</p>

<h2>Option 2: Photography Portfolio</h2>
<p>One of my long standing hobbies is photography. I've taken many family photos, senior<br />
photos, and engagement photos. I've always wanted to put myself out there more, and I<br />
believe a portfolio page would be the perfect way to start. I also think this option<br />
would be the most fun as I would have more design freedom.</p>

<h2>Option 3: Corporate Blog</h2>
<h2>My third option for a website is creating a blog page for my job. I am responsible for<br />
creating a newsletter, and the format we currently use is difficult for people outside<br />
of our organization to see. I believe it would be beneficial to create a seperate<br />
webpage so anyone interested in our program would be able to view what we are doing.</h2>
