        <p>Hi! I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2022 at 22 years old. <br>
        Getting diagnosed as an adult as provided me the comfort of knowing my actions have a reason. <br>
        I am someone who suffers greatly from ADHD Paralysis, which is why I thought creating a how to guide <br>
        on how to break the cycle would be beneficial to myself and others who struggle.</p>
