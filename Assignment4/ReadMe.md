They work with a rendering engine described as a painter creating the design the designer intended and connecting to the network to produce the final product. 

2. The Document Object Model is the object representation of the HTML document. The rendering tree is made up by nodes that are images, text, buttons, ordered list, as well as any other element. Those nodes have individal coordinates that the browser uses to create the website as it was intended. 

3. HTML is the mose widely used web language. It is known for displaying document nodes. XML describes document notes, it allows for upgrading without losing data and is stored in plain-text format. XHTML is described as the bridge between the other two because it combines the best part of both of them. Although it is more strict and takes longer to write.
